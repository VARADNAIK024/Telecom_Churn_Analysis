# Telecom_Churn_Analysis
Summary and Recommendations

Objective

The analysis primarily investigates factors influencing customer churn, particularly focusing on payment methods and contract types.

Key Insights

Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts show a higher tendency to churn compared to those on yearly or bi-annual contracts. This suggests that long-term contracts may improve customer retention.

Payment Methods: A significant proportion of customers using electronic checks are more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods (credit cards, bank transfers, etc.). This could be due to convenience or trust issues associated with electronic check payments.

Churn Rate by Tenure

Customers with shorter tenure (less than one year) are more likely to churn, indicating the criticality of initial engagement strategies.

Visualizations

The visualizations, including bar plots and line graphs, highlight the disparity in churn rates by different contract types and payment methods.

Trends over customer tenure show the need for personalized retention strategies.
